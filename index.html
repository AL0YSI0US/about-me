            I want to <i>"pay it forward"</i>. When I am actually making money in this field, I want to pay someoneâ€™s bills while they focus on learning these skills too. I want to collaborate with my fellow Black, Brown, Queer, Neurodivergent community members in their skill development. More than that, I want to model what it looks like for people with tech money to invest in other people and give back. I want to change the culture of how money flows and inspire people to invest in each other.
