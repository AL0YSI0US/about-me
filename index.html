            The dream is to "pay it forward". I want to pay someoneâ€™s
            bills while they focus on aquiring software skills. I dream of collaborating with my fellow Black, Brown,
            Queer, Neurodivergent community members in their skill development. More than that, I want to model what it
            looks like for people with tech money to invest in other people and give back. I want to change the culture
            of how money flows and inspire people to invest in each other.
