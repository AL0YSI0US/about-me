## Reflections

+ **"inline" coding** on an HTML page will override the CSS file providing styles / Style evything in CSS, **use strict**,  and **reset** sheet.
+ **codepen.io** is a great tool for testing / setting up a webpage, it has built in features like css.reset **to turn on predictive text** > Go to *Settings > Editor Preferences > Editor Options > enable predictive text*
+ Sans Serif is best for the web | Sarif is meant for print, visually it appears to have "feet". *The visual density of 'Sans' is less accessible when compared to the 'Sans Sarif font when viewed in a browser'*
+ **JSFiddle** is an online IDE service and online community for testing and showcasing user-created and collaborational HTML, CSS and JavaScript code snippets, known as 'fiddles'. It allows for simulated AJAX calls
